### What is Twitchwatcher:
- Twitchwatcher is a Selenium Bot for Twitch (specialized for valorant) coded in Visual Basic .Net (.exe) for Windows.
- It searches for active Streamers with Valorant Drops enabled.
- It has additional settings such as searching for new Streams if the current Streamer went offline.
- You can add custom messages that the Bot writes into the Streamers chat every x minutes.
- In summary, the Bot does the tasks of a human to be an "active watcher" to maximize the chance of a Drop.
